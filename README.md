# Tableau Sales Dashboard Project

This repository contains the Tableau project for creating an interactive Sales Dashboard that visualizes sales data and performance metrics across multiple regions and time periods.

## Project Overview

The Sales Dashboard provides insights into:
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly and yearly sales performance.
- **Geographic Sales Analysis**: Sales distribution across different regions.
- **Product-wise Sales**: Performance analysis by different product categories.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Metrics such as total revenue, profit margin, and customer acquisition rate.

The dashboard is built using **Tableau**, which allows for interactive data visualization and dynamic filtering.

## Project Structure

- `sales_dashboard.twbx`: The Tableau workbook containing the dashboard and all the visualizations.
- `data/sales_data.csv`: The dataset used in the Tableau workbook. This contains information on sales, regions, products, and customer demographics.
